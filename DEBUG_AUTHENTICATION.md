# BURP Authentication Debugging

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Frontend API Call
- ✅ Removed `message` field from create-account request 
- ✅ Added proper `userProfile` structure
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging

### 2. Backend Routes
- ✅ Fixed signup/login routes returning redirects instead of JSON
- ✅ Added proper error handling and logging
- ✅ Ensured AccountService is properly initialized

### 3. Database Connection
- ✅ Improved database connection handling
- ✅ Removed fallback to mock mode (now fails if DB connection fails)
- ✅ Added proper connection logging

### 4. AccountService Debugging
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging throughout the authentication flow
- ✅ Better error reporting and handling

## Test Steps:

1. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   cd Backend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Check database connection:**
   - Backend should show "✅ Connected to database successfully"
   - Should show "✅ Auth service initialized with User model"

3. **Test authentication flow:**
   - Connect wallet in frontend
   - Check browser console for detailed logs
   - Check backend console for user creation logs

4. **Common Issues to Check:**
   - MongoDB Atlas connection string is correct
   - JWT_SECRET is set in .env file
   - Frontend is calling the correct backend URL (http://localhost:5001)

## Expected Flow:

1. Frontend calls `/auth/nonce` → Gets nonce and sign message
2. User signs message with MetaMask
3. Frontend calls `/auth/create-account` with signature
4. Backend verifies signature and creates/updates user in MongoDB
5. Backend returns user data and JWT token
6. Frontend redirects to `/dashboard`

## Debug Commands:

```bash
# Check if MongoDB is running locally
mongo --version

# Check backend API directly
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/auth/nonce \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"walletAddress":"0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890"}'
```
